# ðŸ§¬ Gene expression analysis
In this bioinformatics assignment, I used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize the similarities and differences between the samples based on their gene expression profiles. It was a useful way to check if the samples clustered together based on the expected biological variables (e.g., organ type or treatment condition).

Next, I compared gene expression between different conditions, such as different organs or treatment conditions. To do this, I used a statistical method called differential gene expression analysis. This method compares the expression of each gene between two or more conditions and identified genes that were expressed differently. I used DESeq2 to perform differential gene expression analysis.

Finally, the differentially expressed genes were identified in order to understand which biological pathways or processes were affected. This was done using gene set enrichment analysis, which compared the differentially expressed genes to known sets of genes involved in specific biological pathways or processes. I used GSEA to perform gene set enrichment analysis.

## The Data

Sequencing libraries created from total extracted mRNAs from different organs of healthy mice, after Cisplatin treatment or kept untreated.

## The Condition
Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat various types of cancer. It works by binding to DNA molecules in cancer cells and causing damage to the DNA strands. The damage caused by cisplatin can activate the cell's DNA repair mechanisms, including nucleotide excision repair (NER).

Nucleotide excision repair is a DNA repair mechanism that removes and replaces damaged nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA) in the DNA strand. NER is a multi-step process that involves the recognition and removal of damaged DNA, followed by the insertion of new nucleotides to repair the damage.

In the case of cisplatin treatment, the drug causes a specific type of DNA damage known as DNA crosslinking, where the two strands of DNA are covalently linked together. This type of DNA damage is particularly toxic and can lead to cell death if left unrepaired. NER plays a critical role in repairing this type of damage caused by cisplatin.

However, cancer cells can also develop resistance to cisplatin by altering their DNA repair mechanisms, including NER. Some cancer cells may overexpress certain proteins involved in NER, allowing them to repair the DNA damage caused by cisplatin more efficiently and survive the treatment.

Overall, the relationship between cisplatin and NER is complex and can have significant implications for the effectiveness of cisplatin chemotherapy in treating cancer. Understanding this relationship is important for developing new strategies to overcome cisplatin resistance and improve cancer treatment outcomes.
